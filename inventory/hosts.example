# Example Ansible inventory file for VPS
# Replace the example hostnames and IPs with your actual server details.
# For more info, see inventory/README.md and group_vars/all.yml.example for primary server setup.

[all:vars]

# IMPORTANT: For initial server setup, use admin user (created by common role)
# The admin user is created with SSH key and sudo privileges
# Use ansible_user=admin for all deployments
ansible_user=admin
# SSH port - uses ssh_port from group_vars/all.yml (defaults to 22)
ansible_port={{ ssh_port }}

# Replace with your actual domain and server IP. Ensure 'domain' is set in group_vars/all.yml
vps.test ansible_host=192.168.88.8
# Ensure 'domain' is set in group_vars/all.yml or group_vars/all.yml.example.

# Use group inheritance for servers on the same host (mirrors the active 'hosts' file structure)

# For multi-server setups, you can specify different hosts directly in functional groups:
[webservers]
# web1.vps.test ansible_host=203.0.113.11
# web2.vps.test ansible_host=203.0.113.12

# Renamed from [mail] in hosts for clarity in example, or could be [mail]
[mailservers]
# mail1.vps.test ansible_host=203.0.113.13

# You can add more groups and hosts as needed
# [groupname]
# host1 ansible_host=ip.address.1.1
# host2 ansible_host=ip.address.2.2

# To use variables for a specific host or group, create a file in group_vars/ or host_vars/
# Example: group_vars/webservers.yml or host_vars/web1.vps.test.yml
