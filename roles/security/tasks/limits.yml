# System limits configuration (moved from common role)

- name: Set custom limits.conf
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: system/limits.conf.j2

# Note: The sysctl configuration part from the original common/tasks/limits.yml
# (related to system/sysctl.conf.j2 and 'reload sysctl' handler)
# will remain in the common role for now, as sysctl settings like fs.file-max
# are general system settings, not strictly user/security specific.
# If we decide later that specific sysctl settings are purely for security,
# they can be moved and managed by the security role.
