  - risky-file-permissions          # 23 violations - requires security review
  - name[casing]                    # Naming conventions - fix incrementally
  - ignore-errors                   # Should use failed_when - requires logic review

  - yaml[line-length]               # Line length - cosmetic

  - name[missing]                   # Missing names - fix incrementally
